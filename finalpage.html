          In the recent book “Slow Media: Why ‘Slow’ is Satisfying, Sustainable,
          and Smart,” the journalist and media scholar Jennifer Rauch traces a
          movement that began to coalesce about a decade ago.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2010, a document called “The Slow Media Manifesto” was published,
          online, by Sabria David, Jörg Blumtritt, and Benedikt Köhler—a trio of
          Germans with backgrounds in media and technology. It urged both
          journalists and readers to draw inspiration from the Slow Food
          movement, which emphasizes quality and timelessness.

        <p>
          “Slow Media are not about fast consumption but about choosing the
          ingredients mindfully and preparing them in a concentrated manner,”
          the authors wrote. “Slow Media cannot be consumed casually, but
          provoke the full concentration of their users.
        </p>

        <p>
          As with the production of a good meal, which demands the full
          attention of all senses by the cook and his guests, Slow Media can
          only be consumed with pleasure in focused alertness.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Rauch points to the U.K.-based quarterly Delayed Gratication, which
          was established in 2011, as an example of Slow Media in action.
          Delayed Gratication, which has a Web site but is primarily
          print-based, describes itself as “the world’s first Slow Journalism
          magazine.” It promises to revisit “the events of the previous three
          months to see what happened after the dust settled and the news agenda
          moved on” and declares itself “proud to be ‘Last to Breaking News.’”
          Meanwhile, earlier this year, James Harding, the former director of
          news and current affairs at the BBC; Katie Vanneck-Smith, the former
          president of Dow Jones; and Matthew Barzun, the former U.S. Ambassador
          to the United Kingdom, launched Tortoise Media, which aims to publish
          five digital stories a day, along with a quarterly print magazine.
          Tortoise was formed as a direct response to the overwhelming amount of
          “daily noise” in the news ecosystem. “The problem isn’t just fake news
          or junk news,” a statement on the Web site says, “because there’s a
          lot of good—it’s just that there’s so much of it and so much of it is
          the same.
        </p>

        <p>
          In a hurry, partial, and confusing. Too many newsrooms chasing the
          news, but missing the story.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Could journalism in general get slower? As I read about the Slow Media
          movement, I inevitably thought about trends in the magazine industry
          in the United States, where publications are experimenting with
          paywalls and churning out digital content. The appeal of Slow Media is
          that it pushes back against the technological pressures that are
          shaping journalism more broadly. It is an attempt to take back control
          of the way we experience the news. It is also about relinquishing the
          illusion of knowledge that the passive consumption of news on social
          media facilitates and bringing our best selves to the act of becoming
          informed.
        </p>

        <p>
          The challenge for all media organizations, slow or not, is to chart an
          economically sustainable, responsible course through this landscape of
          conflicting incentives and ideals. The pressures for speed and volume
          created by the digital age can’t be ignored—but they can be resisted.
          Even as publishers try to move more quickly, they can still ask
          themselves whether granular coverage in a given area is really making
          readers better informed. They can still consider sitting out certain
          trending stories, and they can do more, across the board, to engage
          with complexity. Readers, too, can begin to realize they’re being
          ill-served by the current media cacophony. Let’s hope that, when they
          search for alternatives, they will still be able to find journalism
          capable of rising above the din.
