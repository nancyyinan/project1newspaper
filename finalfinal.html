      <h1>The Urgent Quest for Slower, Better News</h1>
    </header>

    <!-- 原文内容容器 -->
    <div class="main-content" id="originalContent">
      <p>
        Last month, I decided to try an experiment with my media diet. Usually,
        in the morning, I skim e-mail newsletters in my in-box, scroll through
        my Twitter feed, and peruse the news apps on my phone; later, in the
        office, I tap through my notifications and monitor more than a dozen
        news-related apps, including Facebook and Twitter, while juggling other
        tasks.
      </p>

      <p>
        I usually feel as though I’m managing to stay abreast of the day’s
        biggest news stories, but my reading tends to be fragmentary—I’m only
        skimming a story or absorbing a partial update. I haven’t stopped
        getting my news in this way, but I’m trying to change my ways to a
        certain extent.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve adopted a new ritual: reading the print edition of the New York
        Times over breakfast and on my commute. Since the early two-thousands,
        when I was a cub reporter at the Times, I’ve had the newspaper delivered
        daily to my door, but, as I’ve started getting more and more of my news
        online, I’ve been neglecting it. Having returned to spending
        uninterrupted time with the print newspaper each morning, I’m engaging
        with the news in a more focussed way.
      </p>

      <p>
        Certainly, I’m able to read more broadly. I’ve read articles that
        weren’t in my social-media feeds, or that I missed while scrolling
        through my apps: reporting on efforts to make Copenhagen a
        carbon-neutral city, on talks between the United States and the Taliban,
        on a new study that found that the size of bullets affects mortality
        rates in shootings. It seems to me that I’ve become better informed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many people have tried such experiments, of course. And much has been
        made of how being tethered to our phones affects everything from our
        attention spans to our psychological well-being.
      </p>

      <p>
        In his new book, “Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy
        World,” Cal Newport, a computer-science professor at Georgetown
        University, marshals evidence that the addictive properties of our
        devices are not accidental but, rather, the product of careful thinking
        by tech companies about the feedback loops that will keep people
        returning to them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Newport’s main indictment is of social-media platforms, but he also
        argues that people need to rethink the way they consume news.
      </p>

      <p>
        Exposure to the online torrent of “incomplete, redundant, and often
        contradictory” information that now invariably follows a major news
        event is counterproductive and leaves us less informed, he writes. Even
        when nothing earth-shattering is happening on a given day, he continues,
        people follow a compulsive pattern of media consumption, triggered by
        any hint of boredom.
      </p>

      <p>
        “If you’re interested in politics, for example, and lean toward the left
        side of the political spectrum, this sequence might go from CNN.com, to
        the New York Times home page, to Politico, to the Atlantic, to your
        Twitter feed, and finally to your Facebook timeline,” he explains.
        Techies might add Hacker News and Reddit; sports fans, ESPN. Media
        companies profit from this “lucrative tic.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Checking ten different sites ten times a day makes them money, even if
        it doesn’t leave you more informed than checking one good site once a
        day,” he concludes.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the recent book “Slow Media: Why ‘Slow’ is Satisfying, Sustainable,
        and Smart,” the journalist and media scholar Jennifer Rauch traces a
        movement that began to coalesce about a decade ago.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2010, a document called “The Slow Media Manifesto” was published,
        online, by Sabria David, Jörg Blumtritt, and Benedikt Köhler—a trio of
        Germans with backgrounds in media and technology. It urged both
        journalists and readers to draw inspiration from the Slow Food movement,
        which emphasizes quality and timelessness.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Slow Media are not about fast consumption but about choosing the
        ingredients mindfully and preparing them in a concentrated manner,” the
        authors wrote. “Slow Media cannot be consumed casually, but provoke the
        full concentration of their users.
      </p>

      <p>
        As with the production of a good meal, which demands the full attention
        of all senses by the cook and his guests, Slow Media can only be
        consumed with pleasure in focused alertness.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Rauch points to the U.K.-based quarterly Delayed Gratication, which was
        established in 2011, as an example of Slow Media in action. Delayed
        Gratication, which has a Web site but is primarily print-based,
        describes itself as “the world’s first Slow Journalism magazine.” It
        promises to revisit “the events of the previous three months to see what
        happened after the dust settled and the news agenda moved on” and
        declares itself “proud to be ‘Last to Breaking News.’” Meanwhile,
        earlier this year, James Harding, the former director of news and
        current affairs at the BBC; Katie Vanneck-Smith, the former president of
        Dow Jones; and Matthew Barzun, the former U.S. Ambassador to the United
        Kingdom, launched Tortoise Media, which aims to publish five digital
        stories a day, along with a quarterly print magazine. Tortoise was
        formed as a direct response to the overwhelming amount of “daily noise”
        in the news ecosystem. “The problem isn’t just fake news or junk news,”
        a statement on the Web site says, “because there’s a lot of good—it’s
        just that there’s so much of it and so much of it is the same.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a hurry, partial, and confusing. Too many newsrooms chasing the news,
        but missing the story.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Could journalism in general get slower? As I read about the Slow Media
        movement, I inevitably thought about trends in the magazine industry in
        the United States, where publications are experimenting with paywalls
        and churning out digital content. The appeal of Slow Media is that it
        pushes back against the technological pressures that are shaping
        journalism more broadly. It is an attempt to take back control of the
        way we experience the news. It is also about relinquishing the illusion
        of knowledge that the passive consumption of news on social media
        facilitates and bringing our best selves to the act of becoming
        informed.
      </p>

      <p>
        The challenge for all media organizations, slow or not, is to chart an
        economically sustainable, responsible course through this landscape of
        conflicting incentives and ideals. The pressures for speed and volume
        created by the digital age can’t be ignored—but they can be resisted.
        Even as publishers try to move more quickly, they can still ask
        themselves whether granular coverage in a given area is really making
        readers better informed. They can still consider sitting out certain
        trending stories, and they can do more, across the board, to engage with
        complexity. Readers, too, can begin to realize they’re being ill-served
        by the current media cacophony. Let’s hope that, when they search for
        alternatives, they will still be able to find journalism capable of
        rising above the din.
